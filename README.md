## Acknowledgement

GUI built with [Sciter](https://github.com/c-smile/sciter-sdk) downloader using [youtube-dl](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl).


Source code is likely never to be published, it is on single file written in a language not used in any CV and have not been documented or touched in two+ years.

You may report issues and request features, but that is likely to not happen, this software is open to investments/sell, even as "it is" now, it is much better than alternatives.
